# Pi_value
Once logged into AWS. Goto services and check for EMR.
Goto Notebooks and create new notebook(I have named it as Pi_calculation). While creating the notebook you can either use existing cluster or create a new cluster. ![Cluster](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56847819/79587747-f9a9d100-80a0-11ea-97b4-86860d32a6d2.JPG)
Here we are creating a new cluster while creating the notebook itself with a single node. Ideally whenever we create on single node all components run on master node i.e core node and task node are not utilized here
