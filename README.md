# Pi_value
Once logged into AWS. Goto services and check for EMR.
Goto Notebooks and create new notebook(I have named it as Pi_calculation). While creating the notebook you can either use existing cluster or create a new cluster. ![Alt text](http:C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\CLOUD COMPUTING\Cluster.JPG)
Here we are creating a new cluster while creating the notebook itself with a single node. Ideally whenever we create on single node all components run on master node i.e core node and task node are not utilized here
